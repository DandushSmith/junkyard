To deploy web service on Render you should have a
[separate repository](https://github.com/foobar167/web_api_for_render)
with a starter application.

I don't know how-to integrate this starter app into a bigger project like `junkyard`.
And it is **unnecessary**, because it takes **6 minutes** to re-deploy after each commit to GitHub.
